# Olympics Analysis

As more than 50,000 athletes, coaches, trainers, and team members head to the land of the rising sun we wondered, "Can Olympic results be predicted?". We analyzed the history of the Summer Olympics to see how past results might help us predict which country will hear their national anthem the most times this year. 

Along with the results of thousands of events our analysis includes non-traditional data including country GDP, life expectancy, and distance from the competing country's capital city to the location of the games. Do these demographic features make a difference in the success of Olympic athletes?

Using advanced machine learning techniques we answer these questions and more on our quest to tackle Tokyo and stand atop the prediction podium.

## The Project
:jp: ### From Tokyo to Tokyo :jp:

Japan is one of just six countries who have hosted the Summer Olympics multiple times since 1900. For our analysis we decided to collect data from the first Summer games in Tokyo in 1964, through the most recent Summer games in Rio de Janeiro, Brazil, in 2016. Our data comprised nearly 22,000 medals won by 141 countries in 335 individual and team events.

Our dataset is broken down by competition data and country data.

Competition data includes:
* Event 
* Discipline
* Gender
* Competing Country 
* Competition Year
* Host Country
* Winning Countries
* Medal won

Country Data includes:

* GDP
* Population
* Life Expectancy


### Unique aspects of our dataset:

Throughout the years many Olympic athletes have unfortunately been disqualified for various reasons. Disqualified athletes must vacate their medals which are then awarded to the competitor in the next spot. Instead of removing the disqualified athletes from our dataset, we chose to view these athletes as their own country, "DQ", to see how they compare to the field.   







### Communication protocols:
* Team members communicated through Zoom video calls and Slack messaging
* Code and resources were reviewed by team members through screen sharing and GitHub
* Resources and code were individually committed to team member branches and routinely reviewed and merged to main project branch.
