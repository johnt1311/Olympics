Look at the country codes. On the medals merge it looks like some were still off. 

Ask Hunter if he caught that some of the codes were off on the events sheet. They need to be trimmed and then re-run the pivot tables. Also, dicuss changing the disqualified country code from 0 to DQ. 

Check country codes and merge on the GDP/population/distance data. Might need to change more ocuntry names or codes. Can probably use the country code worksheet that John has on his distance spreadsheet for the index match. 

Add the multiple linear regression framework to a new script page or to the end of Tucker's script. Probably going with the separate and then we can merge because I can't access the SQL data right now 7-25-2021, until we get it in AWS. 

Look at resources from the links in the Google doc to set up the framework for linear regression and random forest based on the linear regression model.

1) put data in graphs and check lienarity
2) keep linear factors - what do we do with the others? Only use them for categorization?
3) set up the train, test, split blocks.
