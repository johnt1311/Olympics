# Olympics Analysis

As more than 50,000 athletes, coaches, trainers, and team members head to the land of the rising sun we wondered, "Can Olympic results be predicted?". We analyzed the history of the Summer Olympics to see how past results might help us predict which country will hear their national anthem the most times this year. 

Along with the results of thousands of events our analysis includes non-traditional data including country GDP, life expectancy, and distance from the competing country's capital city to the location of the games. Do these demographic features make a difference in the success of Olympic athletes?

Using advanced machine learning techniques we answer these questions and more on our quest to tackle Tokyo and stand atop the prediction podium. :trophy:
